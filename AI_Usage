The design and development of the CubeSat Electrical Power System (EPS) project was primarily 
driven by my own knowledge, research, and problem-solving abilities. I systematically approached 
the problem by carefully reviewing project requirements and using my understanding of electrical 
circuits, satellite power systems, and simulation tools to build the model. 
At various points during the project, AI was used primarily as a supportive guide to sharpen my 
focus, clarify technical details, and confirm best practices. Specifically, AI helped me: 
 Validate the choice of component values such as battery internal resistance, solar input 
representation, and realistic load resistances calculated from power requirements. 
 Understand the appropriate use of pulse and piecewise linear sources for accurately 
simulating orbital sun/eclipse periods. 
 Navigate CircuitJS nuances, especially how to implement timed switching loads using 
MOSFETs or analog switches controlled by square wave voltages. 
 Troubleshoot issues including connections, switch control logic, and waveform generation 
parameters. 
Importantly, the AI acted as an advisor, providing suggestions and explanations while I made the 
f
 Final decisions, adapted the circuit, and corrected errors based on simulation behavior. This 
collaboration allowed me to save time by avoiding common pitfalls and enhanced the accuracy and 
completeness of the EPS model. 
In summary, the core insights, planning, and design were driven by me, with AI playing a crucial role 
as an intelligent assistant that kept me aligned with project goals and provided instant access to 
technical knowledge I could apply effectively.
