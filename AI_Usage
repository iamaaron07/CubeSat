#  Design & Development of CubeSat Electrical Power System (EPS)

The design and development of the **CubeSat Electrical Power System (EPS)** project was primarily driven by my **own knowledge, research, and problem-solving abilities**.  

I systematically approached the problem by:
- Carefully reviewing **project requirements**  
- Applying my understanding of **electrical circuits**, **satellite power systems**, and **simulation tools**  
- Iteratively building and testing the model

##  Role of AI in the Project

AI was used as a **supportive guide**, not as the primary designer. It helped sharpen my focus, clarify technical details, and confirm best practices.  

Specifically, AI helped me to:
- ‚úÖ **Validate component choices**: battery internal resistance, solar input, and realistic load resistances based on power requirements.  
- ‚úÖ **Understand source modeling**: how to use **pulse** and **piecewise linear sources** to simulate orbital sunlight/eclipses.  
- ‚úÖ **Navigate CircuitJS nuances**: implementing **timed switching loads** using MOSFETs/analog switches with square wave control.  
- ‚úÖ **Troubleshoot simulation issues**: including bad connections, switch logic errors, and waveform generation mismatches.

## My Role

- I made the **final design decisions**  
- Adapted the circuit step by step  
- Corrected errors based on **simulation behavior**  

AI acted only as an **advisor**, helping me avoid pitfalls and providing quick access to technical knowledge.  

This collaboration:
-  Saved time  
-  Improved accuracy  
-  Enhanced the completeness of the EPS model

## üìù Summary

The **core insights, planning, and design** of the EPS were driven by me.  
AI played a **crucial but secondary role** as an **intelligent assistant** that kept me aligned with project goals and provided technical clarifications I could apply effectively.
